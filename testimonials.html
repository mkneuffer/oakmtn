Scott and his team replaced our standard painted window and door surrounds with custom paneled cherry wood to emulate our cherry fireplace. Cherry baseboards and crown molding completed the transformation.

<p>The moment we met Scott, the owner, we knew that his word was as strong as his wood! He was professional and polite, walking us through the process and helping to give me exactly what I wanted.<br />Scott sent pictures of my bookcase in progress and kept constant communication via email and phone in regard to our timeline. Delivery and installation went smoothly and my house was left clean and orderly. The piece I ordered was truly beautiful and I have never been happier with a contractor!</p>
<p>We were so happy with Scott's work and his work ethic that my husband and I are trying to find other jobs for Scott to do in our home!</p>
<p>Thank you Scott!"</p></p>

                            <h3>CUSTOM KITCHEN: Custom Butternut Wood Kitchen for a Log Cabin</h3>
                          	<p><p>"I bought one of those houses, back in 1997, that basically was sound but required a major facelift on just about everything in the house. The last thing to do and the most stressful part of the job was the kitchen.</p>
<p>I started searching for a good kitchen guy about 7 years ago. The best I got was several quotes for stock cabinets that just did not fit the look of a log cabin. I just couldn't bring myself to spend all the time and money on a kitchen and not get something that really complimented the cabin.</p>
<p>I teach woodcarving in Wayne at the American Woodcarving School. One Monday Morning a nice gentleman, by the name of Scott, walked into the class and told me he wanted to learn woodcarving. Scott told me that he was a furniture/cabinet maker and was looking to increase his carving skills as an enhancement to his custom woodworking business. We struck up a friendship and he asked me to come see his shop. I expected to see this little, dimly lit, crowded garage but was pleasantly surprised by this massive one man shop that Scott had put together. After visiting his shop Scott naturally asked to see my home shop and it occurred to me that I could kill two birds with one stone and invite him over to see the workshop but also take advantage of his special skills and have him take a look at my kitchen and bath. I honestly felt that having someone like Scott come in and give me a quote on custom cabinets was not going to be an option for me because of the price. I actually told this to Scott when he visited and he said "you might be surprised how affordable custom cabinets can be." He contacted us a short while later and was correct. I knew our search for a cabinetmaker had come to an end and we promptly gave him a deposit.</p>
<p>Scott designed a kitchen for us that is truly one of a kind and has transformed the look of the interior of the house, since it is the first thing you see when you come in; Solid Butternut face frames and doors. Where do you ever see that! I've personally never seen it before now. If you're unfamiliar with Butternut it is one of the favorites of woodcarvers for it's warmth and figure. We wanted country, and we wanted unique and that's exactly what we got and we couldn't be happier."</p></p>
